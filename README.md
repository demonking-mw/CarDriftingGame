# CarDriftingGame
A simple (and somewhat stupid) game base that implements the physics of a car. The behavior of understeering is ignored.

THIS IS A PLATFORM FOR A GAME! NOT A GAME ON ITS OWN.
The car is decently implemented and ready for use, note that the steering is done by mouse movement.
Add some basic ui for the game to be playable.

ULTIMATE GOAL:
Train a ML model that drives the car for me. 
Make different car driving models and put them to race.
This is partly why the UI is not implemented, only the car
This part is currently under development, stay tuned for more!
